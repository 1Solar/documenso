## Yes to Yes
> [Check out Part 1](https://documenso.com/blog) to learn about signing freelance proposals with Documenso and getting your first yes

A basic rule of sales if going from "yes to yes". Outlining the main points of working together in a proposal is a good way to getting to your first yes, since it reduces details and focuses on the main points of the work at hand. After being on the same page about the work and getting the first yes, it's time to draw up a formal contract. While agreeing to the proposal has some weight as well, the legal contract formalizes the commmitments of both sides in an enforceable way. Having clear legal terms on payments, unexpected cases and even dissolving the partnership helps both parties to feel asured in what to expect.

### **Digital Signatures for the Win**
Digitally signing documents accelerates the closure of contracts, enhancing both speed and security. Parties can review and sign documents within minutes, eliminating the days required for manual signatures or even weeks with traditional mail. Beyond these efficiency gains, digital signatures boost trust by making the process secure and auditable. Once signed, digital documents are immutable, and every step is logged.

While there are a lot of good tempaltes out there, be sure to verify that they fit your case, since contracts are often verify specific for a certain case. Always consider having your contract checked by a legal professional if it's a high-value transaction.

## Getting the Signature

To further customize the experience, you can define a redirect of your customer signs to redirect them to a Cal.com Link to get started, a Thank You Page or a Form.
