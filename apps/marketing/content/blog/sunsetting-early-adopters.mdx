# The End of the Beginning

8 months, 13 releases, and 344 merged pull requests after announcing the Early Adopter plan in our first-ever launch week, we hit the cap of 100. Documenso has changed and grown a lot since then. For us, this is a great milestone towards our broader mission of bringing open signing to the world since now we are joined by a community consisting of contributors and early customers all around the world. 

# The New Plans

Starting today, we are sunsetting the Early Adopter Plan in favor of our new, more nuanced pricing model. The Early Adopter plan will succeeded by the **Individual plan**, which is still priced at $30/mo. The Individual plans will still include unlimited signatures and recipients, since this aligns with our core belief of empowering our users wherever possible.

Previously soft-launched as part of Early Adopters, we are now officially introducing the **Team Plan** to our pricing for customers requiring multi-user accounts. Priced at $50/ mo. for 5 users, this plan offers unlimited signature volume as well. Additional users can be added for $10/mo. as needed. We have carefully crafted the billing of teams to ensure that dynamic changes are accurately reflected at the end of each billing cycle, providing you with a fair-value pricing structure.

Our **Free Plan** stays unchanged, offering coverage to casual users as well as an easy way to try out Documenso or start developing.

You can check out our [new pricing page here](https://documen.so/pricing). We also updated our [open page](https://documen.so/open) to reflect the end of Early Adopters. The metric now counts active subscriptions from Individuals and Teams.

# API Access

While all plans offer access to the API, we are adding sensible limitations for individual plans. The free plan currently is limited to 5 signatures/ mo., and the Team Plans don‚Äôt have a limit by design. We do want to enable extensive API usage in the Individual Plan as well, yet having no limit would allow running a platform facilitating thousands of signatures on $30/mo, which we don‚Äôt consider fair value (except for Early Adopters Plans, of course). Individual plans will offer 100 signatures (completed documents) per month. All other API access, like creating or reading documents, will still be possible after reaching the limit.

We also have a lot in the pipeline, and we are excited to share everything with you soon. Big Shoutout to all Early Adopters, you will get preferred treatment where possible.
