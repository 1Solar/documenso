## What is an NDA?
An NDA, or non-disclosure agreement, is a legal contract that establishes a confidential relationship. The parties involved agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. NDAs are often used to protect sensitive information or trade secrets and to ensure that such information isn't made public by the recipient without permission. They are commonly used in business settings, such as during negotiations or when new employees are hired who will have access to proprietary information.

There is a solid amount of debate around the question, if an NDA actually protects anyone and is worth the friction. Investor scoff at the idea of a startup requring them to sign an NDA before disclosing their "billion dollar idea", as they see hundred of them and are aware that without proper execution there is nothing to protect.

In another classical example, a big company and a small company e.g. a startup, sign an NDA before going into detail for partnership talks. While this seems prudent, given the ressource asymmetry, the startup won't be able to successfully litigate against breach of contract. If Microsoft (not saying they do) breaks your NDA, you will hardly sue them into a settlement.

That being said, as with most contracts, NDA can be usefull if both parties keep the spririt of the agreement. In this case, detailing in writing what can and cannot be disclosed is good for managing expectation and building trust. NDAs are also common practice in Merger and Acquisitions projects as well as part of ciritical roles within a company.

### Level 1: Basic Signing
Signing and NDA with Documenso is incredibly fast already. Let's take a look how to make it even faster:

- Upload the NDA PDF template
- Add the recipients
- place the signature fields
- Hit send
- Sign the NDA while or after waiting for your counterpart to sign

If you have to sign the same NDA multiple times with different people, you can create a template to save time. Creating a template is just as easy as creating a document, just skipping the sending step. After creating the template for your NDA, you can create a signable documenso with just 1 click. Simply fill in the recipient email and your are done.
> Pro Tip: Check "Send Document" to immediatly send after filling the recipient, if you are familiar with the template.

### Level 3: Using a Direct Link
Using a pre-defined template is pretty fast, but can we make it even faster? Yes, we can! By adding a direct link to your NDA template and publishing it (internally or even externally). A [Direct Link](http://documenso.com/blog/announcing-direct-links) let's people sign your NDA without you lifting a finger. Everyone with access to the link can sign it at any time, making discussion who sends what, when superfluous. You can use Direct links with a pre-signed template for maximum convenience, or with a second signer/ approver from your side, to keep control over the process.

You can try it here and [sign a demo NDA](https://documen.so/demo-nda) with me.

> Pro Tip: Use [Zapier](https://documen.so/zapier) to get notified that plattform of your choice as soon as someone signs your link.
