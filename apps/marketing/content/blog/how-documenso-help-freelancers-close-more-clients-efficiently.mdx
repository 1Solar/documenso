Getting new clients, or maybe even your first client, to sign with you is at the very core of freelance work. Whether you develop software, create designs or market products, it all starts with a signature from you and your future customer. Closing a customer usually means agreeing on a proposal first and then signing a formal agreement afterward. Signing proposals and contracts is fast, easy and painless with Documenso.

## Understanding Proposal and Contracts

### 1. Initial Proposal

> Agreeing on what needs to be done a terms for payment

A proposal will include the scope of of the work (what does the customer want done?), desired deliverables (documents, code, features, videos etc.), timelines, payment terms (one-time, monthly, per hour), prices (e.g. $60/ hour, $5k one-time). A proposal is important for both sides to be clear what the goal is and what terms apply. A customer usually decides if the offer is what they want based on the proposal.

### 2. Formal Contract

> After you and the client signed the proposal a contract can be signed, formalizing the agreement and adding detailed legal terms.

Once the terms are agreed, a more formal document should specify the terms of working together, especially legal details Confidentiality, Indemnification, Governing Law etc. The contract provides clarity on legal detail for both sides and formalizes the claim of both sides.

Sending one or even multiple documents to a potential client and have them send them back signed (worst case they send it via actual mail) is time-consuming for both sides. It is also introducing friction at a time when making it as easy as possible for your potential client to say yes should be your number 1 goal.

### **Digital Signatures for the Win**

Signing documents digitally makes closing proposal and contracts faster and more secure. Each party can review and sign the documents in question in minutes instead of days (inserting the signatures manually or even weeks (using conventional mail).
